I'm building an MCP for Ableton Live.

Setup this repo to be a python 3.12 project using poetry and just (https://github.com/casey/just)

any build/check/lint/etc commands should be runnable via a `just` command in `justfile`

use best pythonic coding standards according to PEP8.

we should use a linting tool like Black to enforce code style.

also include a github workflow for CI that runs check and tests.

initialize a .gitignore with the sensible entries for a project of this type.
